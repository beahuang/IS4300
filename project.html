					<h4>Project Assignment #1</h4>

							<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Collecting comic books is an expensive hobby that requires a lot of physical space. Due to this,
								many users are turning to electronic versions of their favorite comics. The problem is that comic
								book readers have a hard time reading and uploading their comics online. The only sites that
								currently have this function also has a non­intuitive user interface. Another problem is the huge
								volume of comic releases daily; it is almost impossible to keep up with the amount of comic
								issues that a user is currently reading.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Target Users:</b></p>
							<p>Our target users are comic book enthusiasts who want an online resource to upload and read
								virtual copies of comic book issues. These users might have poor organizational skills so they
								can use this as a well designed catalogue. Other target users can also be casual readers that
								can appreciate good design.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
							<p>We will create a web application that will let you upload as many comic files as you want and
								read it online. You can put in a reading list and it'll let you know what issue you have read. We
								will also have a list of any comic book issues have recently came out. This list will allow filtering
								through by keywords. This is going to be written as a Javascript front­end web application and
								Java/Python backend.
