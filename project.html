							<p><b>Interaction Scenarios:</b></p>
							<p>
								<b>Scenario 1: Uploading own file:</b><br/>
								Matt is a 21 year old college student who is also an avid comic book reader. After commuting from home for the first two years of his college life he is excited to finally live on campus. However, to save on housing costs he has to share a small dorm room with two other roommates. He can’t bring his prized collection 150 Original Batman mint-condition issues to display nor does he have much space for the other 10 series he is currently keeping up with. He realizes that continuing to collect physical issues will be an issue and stumbles upon Comicable, an online repository for electronic versions of comics. Comicable allows him to keep up with all of his favorite issues in a way that doesn’t take up room in his small dorm. He logs into the website with his username and password and it brings him to the homepage displaying his last 15 read comics by their cover. On the upper right side he clicks the upload button to start importing the latest files he has. The upload button opens up a dialogue box where he can choose the file he wants to upload. Once the file is uploaded onto Comicable, the dialogue box changes so he can describe the comic he just uploaded. In this dialogue box he can upload a cover image, input the title, issue number, author, genre and short description. Once he exits he will see the comic file he just uploaded displayed first on the homepage. He likes being able to upload his own files and can easily keep adding issues as they come out.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Scenario 2: Purchasing from Comicable:</b><br/>
								Beth is a 12 year old middle school student who saw the Avengers movies and wants to get into the comic book scene however, she has no idea where to start. She tries to go into a bookstore but all doesn’t know where to get them. She has to find a specialty comic shop but when she’s there, the physical issues are too expensive. The comic book store owner introduced her to their new collaboration program with Comicable. She creates a new account for Comicable in store and immediately logs in. Her homepage does not have any files shown in the top dashboard because her account is new but the second dashboard shows her the recently released comic issues by cover. She filters through the issues by searching for any titles named “Avengers”. Under each Avengers covers there is the title and the symbol “$”. For the price of less than half a physical issue, she can click the “$” symbol on Comicable and simply buy the electronic version from the store. Once she pays, the issue will immediately be shown on the top dashboard. She would save a lot in the long run if reading comics becomes a hobby and she can carry all her files without weighing her down.
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Scenario 3: Creating a Favorites/Reading List:</b><br/>
								Annie is a tech-savvy, 28 year old office worker who likes to read electronic comics in her spare time. She recently received a large amount of electronic issues from her friend and is currently storing all these files locally in Calibre, an ebook manager. However, she is starting to get overwhelmed by the amount of unordered files and lack of categories. She starts an Excel spreadsheet to organize everything but soon abandons it after finding out about Comicable. She makes an account with Comicable and immediately begins uploading all her files through the upload button. When she is done, she is taken back to the front page where they are all displayed on the top dashboard. She realizes she only wants to read through one complete series at a time. She chooses to read Justice League first and filters them to only show Justice league comics. Then by selecting the “♥” under the cover, they will be added to a reading list so she can easily access them from the front page. She also likes having the option to delete in case she changes her mind about which comics to keep up with.

								We chose to go with option #2 because we thought it was the cleanest out of the three and the least cluttered design-wise. The grid format allows the comic book cover to be the main attraction with more descriptive options available at the click of a small button. The tabs keep each main task separate: My files, Recently Added, and Reading List.

					<h4>Project Assignment #2</h4>

						<li><p><b>Title:</b> Comicable</p></li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
							<p>As much fun as reading paper comics can be, there are certain limitations to it. First and most important one is space. Because of how much space it takes to hold on to so many issues and because so many issues exist, many comic book readers are turning to electronic versions of their favorite comics. Just like how there is Kindle for books, or Calibre to manage e-books libraries, or numerous websites for magazines and newspapers, there are also some comic book sites as well. The only sites that allow users to read and upload their own comic files have a complicated and unappealing user interface. These sites don’t have the option to keep track of new releases or have a reading list to keep up with the amount of comic issues a user is currently reading. With the many comic universes and parallel timelines that exist, it is almost impossible to keep track of your issues unless you had a reference to guide you.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Users:</b></p>
							<p>Our primary stakeholders are comic book enthusiasts. They would have to be technologically friendly because our idea is basically a webpage where users can upload their favourite comics, browse for other comic books, and create their own shareable reading lists. These kind of users will directly benefit from our project, as it will make it a better experience being passionate about comic books.
								<br/><br/>
								John is a 21 year old college student who has grown up with comic books his whole life. He is now at Northeastern University studying computer science and is an avid fan of Aquaman.
								<br/><br/>
								Our secondary stakeholders would be other comic book websites and comic book sellers. Although our project’s intention isn’t to lower their online engagement or customer buyings, it will have a slight negative impact on them. The more people start to use online services the less they'll go out and actually buy physical copies of comic book issues. Comic book stores will have the option to sell electronic version of their comics for cheaper and they pay us to host the files.
								<br/><br/>
								Mary age 55, is the CEO of a local comics book store chain. She has realized that more and more people have stopped coming into her store. She wants to keep her store afloat and wants to go electronic.

								<b>Scenario 1:</b> Uploading own files
								<br/>
								Matt is a 21 year old college student who is also an avid comic book reader. After commuting from home for the first two years of his college life he is excited to finally live on campus. However, to save on housing costs he has to share a small dorm room with two other roommates. Matt brings all his comic books to campus and realizes that he has nowhere to put them except in the dusty corner under his bed. He realizes that continuing to collect physical issues will be an issue and hopes to find a more convenient way to keep up with his favorite series.

								<b>Scenario 2:</b> Ease of use
								<br/>
								Beth is a 12 year old middle school student who saw the Avengers movies and wants to get into the comic book scene however, she has no idea where to start. She tries to go into a bookstore but all doesn’t know where to get them. She has to find a specialty comic shop but when she’s there, the physical issues are too expensive so she wants to look for an online source. She found some files for the comics but when she tried to google around for a good app to use she comes up short. She wishes there was an foolproof way to read her comics online.

					<h4>Project Assignment #1</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p><b>Problem:</b></p>
							<p>Collecting comic books is an expensive hobby that requires a lot of physical space. Due to this,
								many users are turning to electronic versions of their favorite comics. The problem is that comic
								book readers have a hard time reading and uploading their comics online. The only sites that
								currently have this function also has a non­intuitive user interface. Another problem is the huge
								volume of comic releases daily; it is almost impossible to keep up with the amount of comic
								issues that a user is currently reading.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Target Users:</b></p>
							<p>Our target users are comic book enthusiasts who want an online resource to upload and read
								virtual copies of comic book issues. These users might have poor organizational skills so they
								can use this as a well designed catalogue. Other target users can also be casual readers that
								can appreciate good design.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<p><b>Solution:</b></p>
							<p>We will create a web application that will let you upload as many comic files as you want and
								read it online. You can put in a reading list and it'll let you know what issue you have read. We
								will also have a list of any comic book issues have recently came out. This list will allow filtering
								through by keywords. This is going to be written as a Javascript front­end web application and
								Java/Python backend.
